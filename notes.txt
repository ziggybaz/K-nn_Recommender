			K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
There's no special spin to my implementation, it's just one of those things I've wanted to know the underlying workings in-depth,
So don't look at this project as a source for learning the algorithm, you'll be better off reading the whitepaper.

Re-inventing the wheel? 
Nah, I'm just parroting what's already out there to improve my understanding of the subject-matter (might even endup improving or disproving the thesis, lol).

So what is it?
Well in basic terms, K-Nearest Neighbour is a simple classification algorithm.

What am I trying to figure out?
I'm trying to find the best value for 'K' to improve the performance. It's out there, and I will find it.

a good starting point that without being bogged-down by the math. This has to be the simplest explanation out there, even a child would understand

	2.K-NN Whitepaper.
is a paper that addresses the shortcomings of the algorithm (low efficency && dependence on the selection of a 'good value' for `K`).
*they solve or try to solve the 'dimensionality curse' by creating a system that automatically determines the value of 'K'
